Building upon skills learned from other web development courses (basic bootstrap, jquery, and ruby) I'm going to be building a series of websites provided by this course. I'm going to be focusing more on the Python, PHP and SQL given in this course, since it's something I haven't tackled yet.

In addition to the new languages, I'd like to have more time and practice with jQuery and JS, because other classes I've taken on them have been more of a "copy what I code" lesson rather than applying critical thinking skills. As such, all of these projects were created without looking at the code supplied by the instructor, but cleaned up along with him.
